      <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>  
        <p>
          Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. 
          <br>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe
          <br>below, but let's go over the basics:
        </p>


        <h3>Lasagna Ingredients</h3>
          <p>
            The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly
            <br>customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you
            <br>want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll
            <br>need to add to your grocery list:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat</strong>: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground <br> beef.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong>: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the <br> meat to add tons of flavor.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Tomato products</strong>: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of <br> tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance <br> the flavor of the sauce.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, <br> dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>: Use store-bought or <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/266023/homemade-lasagna-sheets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">homemade lasagna noodles</a>.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra <br> decadent.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when <br> you cut into it.</li>
          </ul>


        <h3>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h3>
          <p>
            Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade <br> lasagna:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Make the meat sauce.</li><br>
            <li>Cook the noodles.</li><br>
            <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li><br>
            <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li><br>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li><br>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
          </ol>
    

        <h3>How to Layer Lasagna</h3>
          <p>
          The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but this is <br> the order you'll follow:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Meat sauce</li><br>
            <li>Noodles</li><br>
            <li>Ricotta mixture</li><br>
            <li>Mozzarella slices</li><br>
            <li>Meat sauce</li><br>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li><br>
           <li>Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
          </ol>


        <h3>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h3>
          <p>
            The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven
            <br>preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it
            <br>cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna
            <br>rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.
          </p>

      <h2>How to Reheat Lasagna</h2>  
        <p>
          You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on
          <br>time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The best way to
          <br>reheat lasagna is in the oven.Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350
          <br>degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is
          <br>bubbly.
        </p>


      <h2>How to Freeze Lasagna</h2> 
        <p>
          If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil baking dish. Allow
          <br>the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at least one layer of storage
          <br>wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Freeze for up to
          <br>three months.
        </p>


        <h3>How to Reheat Frozen Lasagna</h3>
          <p>
            Thaw the frozen lasagna in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the reheating
            <br>instructions above. If you don't have time to thaw in the fridge, you can reheat it
            <br>from frozen — just make sure to add a few minutes to the cook time to ensure
            <br>the dish is heated through.

      <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>
        <p>
          "We live in St. Louis where we have fabulous Italian food," says

          <br>"This lasagna could've come from any of the well-known restaurants in our area.
          <br>My family was raving about it! The sauce is absolutely amazing! This is definitely
          <br>a keeper! It lives up to its name."
          <br>
          <br>"The sweet Italian sausage and ground beef combo along with the sauce were
          <br>very flavorful," says one Allrecipes community member. "Yeah it may take a
          <br>while but it is so worth it. Team it with <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21060/toasted-garlic-bread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">garlic bread</a> and a salad and you'll be 
          <br>very satisfied."

          <br>"Absolutely phenomenal," raves <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/16014652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda Simopoulos</a>. "Fair warning: once
          <br>you've made this, going back to a frozen lasagna will be impossible. It is
          <br>somewhat time consuming but not difficult. My house smells delectable every
          <br>time I make it!
